		<p>Color is more than just a hue. It expresses a feeling. Makes a statement. Declares an allegiance. Color reveals your personality. iPhone 5c, in five anything-but-shy colors, does just that. It’s not just for lovers of color. It’s for the colorful.</p>

	<div id="tab-2" class="tab-content">
    	<h2>Tab Two</h2>  
		<p>A6 chip. 8MP iSight camera. 4-inch Retina display. Ultrafast LTE wireless. iPhone 5c has the things that made iPhone 5 an amazing phone — and more, including iOS 7. All in a completely new design that feels great in your hand.</p>

	<div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
    	<h2>Tab Three</h2> 
		<p>Every feature we add to iPhone must answer yes to one question: Will it make the experience better? So the colors of iPhone 5c received the same intense consideration we apply to everything we make. We even designed the Home screen and wallpaper colors to complement the exterior. As a result, using iPhone is that much more engaging and delightful.</p>
